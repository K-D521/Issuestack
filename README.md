## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following tools installed:

```
Node.js version 14.0.0 or higher
npm version 5.6 or higher
```

### Installing

To install dependencies locally, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

## Deployment

For deployment, I utilized Netlify. I imported the existing front-end project from GitHub and configured the required build settings. Once the deployment process finished, the application went live and became accessible through the provided link.

To build the React app, execute the following command:

```
npm run build
```

To start the React app on your local machine, use the following command:

npm run start
```
